<p>Visual Design in web development is a broad topic.</p>
<p>It combines typography, color theory, graphics, animation, and page layout to help deliver a site's message.</p>
<p>The definition of good design is a well-discussed subject, with many books on the theme.</p>
<p>At a basic level, most web content provides a user with information. The visual design of the page can influence its presentation and a user's experience. 
In web development, HTML gives structure and semantics to a page's content, and CSS controls the layout and appearance of it.</p>
<p> I use:<br>
- the CSS @keyframes and animation properties<br>
- Make a CSS hearbeat using an infinite animation count<br>
- How bezier curves work
